# Quality of Race and Ethnicity Data in the EHR

**Objective:** The purpose of this study is to assess the completeness of data collection for race and ethnicity in the Electronic Health Record of multiple institutions in the US.

**Rationale:** Given the fact that this type of data is used to study health disparities as well as to perform risk assessment for patients, it would be valuable to know the current state of race and ethnicity from a quality perspective.
